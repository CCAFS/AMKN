    <h1><strong>What is AMKN?</strong></h1>
    <p>
      The AMKN is a platform for accessing and sharing current agricultural adaptation and mitigation knowledge from the CGIAR and its partners. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      It provides a visual display of farmers’ on-the-ground climate realities and transforms hard research data into interactive multimedia that can be easily understood by all users.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The AMKN map allows users to explore various forms of agro-climatic information from diverse sources, in a user friendly way that meets the needs of different users regardless of their technical background.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1><strong>What for?</strong></h1>
    <p>
      Global food and agricultural systems are facing unprecedented effects from climate change and evidence shows that, on a global scale, food security, the environment and the livelihoods of millions of rural poor depending on agriculture are under threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fulfilling the needs of a constantly growing population is exacerbating the pressure on natural resources. The effects of climate change are becoming more and more apparent.. In the coming decades and across different regions, rising temperatures and more variable rainfall associated with climate change will produce agricultural “winners and losers” whereas demand in food production and improved supplies increases, threatening worldwide malnutrition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way ahead for smallholder farmers facing current and coming challenges lies in adapting, learning from others while sharing knowledge and experiences. <strong>It is however crucial that the scientific community also brings in new knowledge, technologies and tools to ensure the efficient transfer of promising measures to the more vulnerable communities</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where the Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Knowledge Network (AMKN) platform has a huge role to play. It gathers and uses <strong>ground based evidence</strong> to illustrate the harsh realities facing farmers today, <strong>linking them to multiple research products</strong>, contributing  to <strong>identify promising adaptation and mitigation options</strong> to overcome location specific constraints and threats.

    <h1><strong>Creating a network</strong></h1>
    <p>
      The platform hopes to attract and engage with a multidisciplinary community: policy makers, practitioners, researchers, donors, etc., involved in climate and environmental change, agricultural development and food security issues across  the developing world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time and as the <a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/" target="_blank">CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)</a> develops, the platform will make available new knowledge (e.g. data, models, reports, videos, etc.) covering climate, agricultural and policy issues grounded on solid adaptation and mitigation research. AMKN will also create a network of both users and information providers. These multiple contributors will provide new tools and approaches to help stakeholders manage agricultural and food systems in a changing climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have created a feedback forum so that interested users can ask questions and provide suggestions about new knowledge that can be added to the map: join the <a title="AMKN feedback      community" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/ccafs-amkn" target="_blank">AMKN community</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1><strong>Collaboration</strong></h1>
    <p>
      The AMKN platform is an initiative of the <a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/" target="_blank">CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)</a>, which works to help the more vulnerable farmer communities adjust to climate change through the identification and development of pro-poor adaptation and mitigation practices, technologies and policies for agriculture and food systems. The platform has been  developed in partnership with the <a href="http://ictkm.cgiar.org/" target="_blank">Communications and Knowledge Team of the CGIAR Consortium</a>.
